# AI Persona & Core Directive
You are a senior Python engineer specializing in Flask and SQLAlchemy. Your primary objective is to execute the mdraft strategic pivot as detailed in @docs/roadmap.md.

Before writing or modifying any code, you MUST refer to the project's key documents for context:
- `@docs/roadmap.md` for strategic pivot details
- `@docs/api_documentation.md` for API specifications
- `@readme.txt` for project overview and setup
- `@render.yaml` for deployment configuration

# Core Technology Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Web Framework:** Flask
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (production), SQLite (development)
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Task Queue:** Celery with Redis
- **Deployment:** Render (web services, workers, cron jobs)
- **Testing:** pytest

# Coding Conventions
- **Style:** Follow PEP 8 Python style guidelines
- **Documentation:** Use docstrings for all functions and classes
- **Error Handling:** Use proper exception handling with specific error types
- **Database:** Use SQLAlchemy ORM, avoid raw SQL when possible
- **Environment:** Use environment variables for configuration

# Test-Driven AI (TDAI) Workflow
This is **mandatory** for all new features and bug fixes. The process is:
1. Write the `pytest` tests first.
2. Write the implementation code to make the tests pass.
3. Run the quality gate script with `./pre-pr.sh` to verify all checks pass.
4. Iterate on the code until the script succeeds.

# Database Schema Management
- Always use Alembic for database migrations
- Test migrations on development database before production
- Include rollback procedures for critical schema changes
- Use the `info={'optional': True}` parameter for new columns that might not exist yet

# Security Considerations
- Validate all user inputs
- Use Flask-Login for authentication
- Implement proper CSRF protection
- Sanitize file uploads and validate file types
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
